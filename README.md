- <b>Implementation of redundant service infrastructure to guarantee continuity and resilience</b>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This project focuses on designing and deploying a highly available multi-server architecture to ensure 
continuous and reliable access to essential organizational services. The infrastructure integrates a 
secondary DNS server, DFS Namespace, DFS Replication, and NFS to maintain service redundancy and consistent 
data availability across multiple servers.
</p>
<p>
To improve data confidentiality and access control, Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are applied to specific 
Organizational Units, including Management, Human Resources, and Finance. This segmentation ensures that 
sensitive information is accessible only to authorized users.
</p>
<p>
The overall solution is engineered with fault tolerance in mind, allowing services to remain operational 
even in the event of a primary server failure. Through redundancy, automated data synchronization, and 
structured access control, the project delivers a secure, resilient, and efficient service environment.

- <b>Secure Multi-Service Enterprise Network Architecture Project</b> 
 <h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
This project focuses on designing and deploying a secure and reliable enterprise network infrastructure.
It integrates essential network services such as routing, switching, NTP time synchronization,
NAT/PAT for controlled internet access, and secure web-based services. The architecture includes strong
security measures to protect users, data, and communication both internally and between remote branches.
</p>
<p>
The network is built to ensure resilience, stability, and protection against common threats, providing
a robust foundation for an organization’s daily operations.
